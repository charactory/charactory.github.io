summary: "When will I be released?"

"When will I be released?" the prisoner asked.

"The prisoner will be released when he has finished serving his sentence," the guard answered.

"And when can I expect that to happen?"

"The prisoner will have served his sentence when the king has decided he is fit to go."

The guards changed every day, but their words did not. Every morning, the prisoner listened to the sounds of the
guard climbing the stairs to his room, with occasional humming, some furtive self-talk, and the rare expletive. 
There were at least two hundred and twenty steps, or as many as the prisoner was
willing to count before the numbers unravelled in his mind and the monotonous thumping of heavy boots ceased to register
in his consciousness; dreaming and thinking blended together in one delirious continuum. And then the door would open, and
awareness return.

It was cold beef stew, in a beaten copper pot.  The prisoner's one and only meal, large and watery and bland, that also served
as his thirst quencher. All his meals were like this. He used to ask for other things, for bread to dip in or cheese or 
even wine, or anything at all apart from the prescribed soup. He was so angry one day he tipped it out on the floor
before the guard left. All that accomplished was to arm the next shift with a mop and bucket.

There was no point trying to escape. They would just catch him again, and add to the sentence.
